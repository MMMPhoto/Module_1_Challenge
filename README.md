# Module_1_Challenge: Code Refactor

This Week One Challenge for the Georgia Tech Part-Time Coding Bootcamp required refactoring code for an existing website to follow assesibility standards and be optimized for search engines. The original code was contained in one HTML file and one CSS style sheet. I editied and condesnsed the code in both files to complete the project. The finished website looks identical to the one produced by the original code, and functions more efficiently. I also fixed a few functions that did not work.

# A Short Synopsis of tasks performed:
* Added semantic elements, refactored applicable CSS
* Added alt tags to images
* Moved background image from style sheet to index file
* Added page title
* Added HTML comments
* Fixed broken nav link
* Condensed CSS in style sheet
* Added CSS comments
* Created this README file
* Deployed site on Github

I found the challenge to be a fun exercise. I had to think creatively in how to condese the code without changing the over all functionality of the site.
